                Not inhabitable. Why? Because it has no solid surface. It is a gas giant without anything in it, just gas. But it has 2 possibly inhabitable moons Titan and Enceladus.<br><br>
                On titan you wouldn’t need even a pressurized suit, just an oxygen mask and really warm clothing, since it has a pressurized atmosphere. Standing on the surface would feel like being in water, since atmosphere is dense. 
                It's surface is covered with methane lakes, plains and icy rocks. Since gravity on Titan is only 14% of Earth's gravity and with help of dense atmosphere, you would be able to do Matrix level tricks. You could go up highest mountain and jump off, using only your coat to gently glide down to sea level.<br><br>1 day on Titan would be 16 Earth days. You would enjoy orange skies in daytime and a faint outline of Saturn through clouds, that rains methane. Biggest problems would be dealing with massive thunderstorms. But otherwise it is just really cold out there, with no cosmic radiation and no moonquakes.

                    On Enceladus there would be problems with intense cold, as temperatures during daytime would reach -200 degrees Celsius. It doesn’t have atmospheric pressure and with that no protection to radiation.<br><br>
                    The best place for a base on Enceladus would be near it`s “tiger stripes” as they work much like hot geysers on Earth, but a lot more powerful. It would provide as much energy as 20 coal power plants on Earth, and it would be possible to tap in to that power to provide heat on this -200 degree weather nightmare.<br><br>
                    The moon isn’t really big, as it is only 482 km in diameter. This moon would be an interesting place to set up a scientific base, as it is believed, that under icy surface there would be some kind of a lifeform, prospering in hot waters.<br><br>
                    Only thing is, that when you would send a message from both of these moons, you would get a bit lonely, as every message you send, would reach Earth in 1 hour and 20 minutes.
