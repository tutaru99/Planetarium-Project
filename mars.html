                    Mars has been a target for our colonies for many years, not only in science fiction movies, but also in real life, as the first manned mission to mars is planned somewhere around 2030. It is planned to build a small base there and there aren’t big hurdles to go around if you compare it to extreme weather on other planets, or seismic activities. <br> <br>
                    Winds aren’t a big problem too on Mars. The only problem would be its dusty environment that could damage electrical devices, by clogging them up. As far as temperature goes, it differs from -60 Celsius to +20 degrees. So, it is nothing a man could not handle.<br><br> 
                    It has a thin layer of atmosphere, that can burn up pebble sized meteors, so it`s relatively safe. There are no quakes, but the difference in temperatures can make massive dust storms. That would be the greatest danger. <br><br> 
                    
                    </p>

            <p id="column_2" >Since there is a thin layer of atmosphere, and no powerful magnetic fields around Mars, astronauts need to take care of cosmic radiation.<br><br> 
                Sightseeing wise Mars would be a spectacular place, as you could sometimes even see some clouds appearing in Mars’s sky, and in mornings you could get greeted by a morning frost, like we see on Earth. That is possible because of Ice caps located on it`s poles.<br><br> 
                Mars even has 38% gravitation, comparing it to Earth`s, so adjusting to it would be a lot easier.<br><br> 
                Of course, it would be a great travel target for UFO hunters as they have their own understanding, that Mars is or was inhabited by intelligent life forms and everything we see on it is made by them.<br><br> 
                One way or another, good luck to our astronauts on Mars mission and let us hope that it doesn’t end like something from Alien movies.</p>
